# Type conversion app

This app will help you learn how JavaScript converts values from one type to another, and how different operations are done when we have different data types.

## Project Description
- The app takes two values from a different type or from the same type and an operation to perform on them, then calculates the result and gives an explanation of the result.

- I used react.js to create the app.

- [have a look at it here](https://typeconversion.netlify.app/)

* features I want to implement 
    1. Type checking for the entered values.
    2. Make a logo.
    3. Different border colors based on the input type.
    4. Add more operations.
    5. Add the possibility to work with objects.
## Usage

- Type object is meant to be used with null, the app currently does not support working with object type values.
* type undefined is for undefined global variable make sure that you enter undefined as a value and type.
