# Type conversion app

This app will help you learn how JavaScript converts values from one type to another, and how different operations are done when we have different data types.

- [have a look at it here](https://typeconversion.netlify.app/)

## Project Description
- The app takes two values from a different type or from the same type and an operation to perform on them, then calculates the result and gives an explanation of the result.

- I used react.js to create the app.



**features I want to implement**
  
    1. Type checking for the entered values.
    2. Make a logo.
    3. Different border colors based on the input type.
    4. Add more operations.
    5. Add the possibility to work with objects.
## Usage

- Enter your **value** then choose the proper **type** for it, repeat it with the second one then choose the operation you want to perform and hit the result button.
- A **popup** should appear with both the result and the explanation. 

- If you have other values to test click on the **reset** button and start entering your values.

**things to keep in mind while working with the app:**
- Type object is meant to be used with null, the app currently does not support working with object type values.
* type undefined is for undefined global variable make sure that you enter undefined as a value and type.
